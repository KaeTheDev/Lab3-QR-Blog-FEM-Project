# Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository contains two simple frontend projects rebuilt from Frontend Mentor challenges: the QR code component and a blog landing page. Both projects demonstrate semantic HTML, SCSS styling, and responsive, mobile-first design using CSS Flexbox.

## Description

These projects were built to practice structuring reusable HTML components, using SCSS for styling, and implementing a mobile-first responsive design. The QR code project focuses on a single-component layout with centered content, while the blog preview card project demonstrates a multi-element component layout using **Flexbox** for alignment and spacing.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Node.js installed (optional, only if using npm scripts)
* Live Server extension for VS Code (or similar) to preview projects
* OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/KaeTheDev/Lab3-QR-Blog-FEM-Project
2. Open the project folder of your choice (`QR` or `Blog`) in VS Code.
3. Ensure you have the Live Server extension installed to preview the project in the browser.

### Executing program

1. Open the HTML file you want to view (`index.html`) in VS Code.
2. Right-click and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
3. Your project will open in the browser, reflecting live changes when you edit SCSS or HTML.

Example command if using npm for SCSS compilation
npm run scss:watch

## Help

If your styles donâ€™t appear correctly:  
* Make sure your SCSS is compiled to CSS.  
* Ensure the Live Server is pointing to the correct HTML file.

Example: compile SCSS manually if needed
sass --watch scss:css
