# LAB 3 - Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository contains two simple frontend projects rebuilt from Frontend Mentor challenges: the QR code component and a blog landing page. Both projects demonstrate semantic HTML, SCSS styling, and responsive, mobile-first design using CSS Flexbox.

## Description

These projects were built to practice structuring reusable HTML components, using SCSS for styling, and implementing a mobile-first responsive design. The QR code project focuses on a single-component layout with centered content, while the blog preview card project demonstrates a multi-element component layout using **Flexbox** for alignment and spacing.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Node.js installed (optional, only if using npm scripts)
* Live Server extension for VS Code (or similar) to preview projects
* OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/KaeTheDev/Lab3-QR-Blog-FEM-Project
2. Open the project folder of your choice (`QR` or `Blog`) in VS Code.
3. Ensure you have the Live Server extension installed to preview the project in the browser.

### Executing program

1. Open the HTML file you want to view (`index.html`) in VS Code.
2. Right-click and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
3. Your project will open in the browser, reflecting live changes when you edit SCSS or HTML.

Example command if using npm for SCSS compilation
npm run scss:watch

## Help

If your styles don’t appear correctly:  
* Make sure your SCSS is compiled to CSS.  
* Ensure the Live Server is pointing to the correct HTML file.

Example: compile SCSS manually if needed
sass --watch scss:css

# REFLECTION QUESTIONS

1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
Having a Figma design file makes the development process much smoother. I prefer using them when building projects because they eliminate guesswork around sizing, padding, colors, and element positioning. It allows me to focus on coding rather than trying to approximate the design.

2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

These projects were relatively simple, so I didn’t face many challenges. One thing I noticed was that not all the styles specified in the style guide were necessary, which made it easier to simplify some of the CSS.

3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

Reviewing my code alongside community feedback helps me ensure I’m following best practices. It also provides opportunities to learn more efficient ways to structure HTML, CSS, or SCSS and refine my coding techniques.
